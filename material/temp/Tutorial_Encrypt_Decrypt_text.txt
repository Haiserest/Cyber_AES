Tutorial Encrypt & Decrypt Text

1. Generate AES and RSA key and will get file "../AES" and "../RSA"
	AES :	AESkey
	RSA :	Private_Key.pem
		Public_Key.pem

2. Encrypt : Browse Your text file (.txt) which you want to encrypt 
	     Browse AESkey and Private_Key.pem to encrypt 
  	     click Submit to Encrypt file and programe will generate file 
	     "AES_encrypt.txt" - file text(.txt) encrypt with AES key
	     "hash" - file AES_encrypt.txt hashing with SHA512
	     "digital_signature" - file hash sign with Private key to be Digital Signature

3. Decrypt : Browse Your text encrypt from AES key to decrypt
	     Browse AESkey, Public_Key.pem and digital_signature to verify and decrypt
	     click Submit to Decrypt and verify file if correct it will generate file
	     "AES_decrypt.txt" - file text(.txt) decrypt with AES key [plaintext]
